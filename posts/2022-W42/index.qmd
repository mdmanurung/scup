## Applications

The Black Death left its mark not only on our history but also on our immunity. Luis Barreiro's lab showed that **natural selection driven by the Black Death, that were protective at that time, could be linked to present-day susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease.**[^1] Great combinations of ancient DNA work, population genomics, and in-vitro infections.

Nicolet and Wolkers showed that **mRNA expression levels are poorly correlated with protein abundance (Pearson r \~ 0.4)**.[^2] Interestingly, certain gene charactistics, such as untranslated region (UTR) lengths, could affect mRNA-protein correlation.

## Methods

Cell-type annotation is a critical step in single-cell analysis pipeline. For scATAC-Seq, we can annotate cells using either tools developed for scRNA-Seq or transfer labels from RNA to ATAC. Here, Yuge Wang and colleagues **performed a thorough benchmarking and showed subpar performance of all these methods.**[^3] Using Multiome data as reference can help improve the accuracy, but only to some extent.

## Technologies

Xiaowei Zhuang published Epigenomic MERFISH, an **imaging-based technology for spatially resolved single-cell epigenomic profiling.**[^4] Epigenomic MERFISH maps active promoters and enhancers in mouse brain and reveals putative enhancer hubs in embryonic mouse brain.

Awesome spatial technologies seem to be published on a weekly basis. I wonder which ones will be commercialized and used around the world?

PacBio, in partnership with the Broad Institute and 10X Genomics, launched the new Multiplexed Arrays Sequencing (MAS-Seq).[^5] This technology **enables long-read scRNA-Seq for identification of alternatively spliced isoforms and gene fusions without the need for *de novo* assembly.**[^6]

Excellent move by 10X's single-cell division! Looking forward to the maneuvers of its spatial division.

## Conversations

**Inter-operability of single-cell analysis frameworks is not enough, the tools should be coherent as well!** Log-fold change calculation in Seurat and Scanpy differs significantly[^7], as pointed out by Nikolai Slavov from a recent benchmarking paper by Davis McCarthy's lab.[^8] This mess begs for a question: **to whom should we handle the responsibility for making the decisions in single-cell data analysis? Developers or Users?**

Related to the post above, Nicola Roman√≤ shared his observation on the danger of default parameters in single-cell analysis frameworks.[^9] If you're using Seurat, **remember to pass your `seed` into its function** instead of declaring it before calling the function, as per usual, **or else the function will override your seed.**

Yet another thread on the danger of (blindly following) the defaults, **Junhyong Kim shared his thoughts on Seurat's CP10K normalization** (i.e. dividing gene count by library depth, multiply by 10K, followed with `log1p`).[^10]. Related to this, Lior Pachter's lab published a benchmark on normalisation methods and suggested proportional fitting --\> log-transformation --\> proportional fitting (PFlog1pPF).[^11] Or should we abandon the normalisation route and instead fully embrace the count nature of scRNA-Seq data?[^12]
