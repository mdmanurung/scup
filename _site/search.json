In this thread, many people shared their thoughts, and as always, there is no one true algorithm. scVI seemed to be the favourite of many, though harmony was also mentioned a lot. However, stupidly simple methods, such as downsampling UMI counts, could actually be the most robust option.3 Anyway, I would recommend to focus less on batch removal (please stop using UMAP or tSNE as your main evidence of a ‘successful data integration’, whatever that means) and emphasise preservation of biological variance. The scib pipeline can help you with measuring batch correction and biological variance conservation metrics.\nHere’s a thread4 sharing DropletQC, a great method to separate cells and empty droplets by Joseph Powell’s lab.
