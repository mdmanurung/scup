    "text": "How conserved are the macrophage responses to bacterial infections? Itai Yanai and colleagues demonstrated the conserved macrophage states in response to various bacterial species, including Group B Streptococcus, despite the variation in the relative frequencies of the states.1. Tweetorial available here.\nSingle-cell dataset imbalance significantly impacts data integration results.2 The authors elaborately described the impact of cell-type imbalance and similarity across samples on clustering, marker-gene-based annotation, and more. Novel clustering metrics that took into account cell-type imbalance were proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime for semi-supervised methods?\n\n\n\nTo my knowledge, cell-type imbalance is exactly what motivates semi-supervised STACAS (ssSTACAS) by Santiago Carmona’s lab. Would be interesting to see how ssSTACAS or other semi-supervised methods fare here and in more complex cases such as the multi-tissue multi-cancer datasets curated by Nick Borcherding.\n\n\nCan we identify cell-type specific genetic variants influencing disease? Aviv Regev and colleagues introduced sc-linker, a framework to integrate scRNA-Seq and GWAS data to identify the likely cell types driving disease.3\nCan we incorporate chromatin accessibility data to improve RNA velocity accuracy estimates? Joshua Welch and colleagues showed that we can in their MultiVelo paper.4 They also showed that this model can reveal the extent of coupling or time lag between epigenomic and transcriptional changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential orderings of chromatin and RNA state changes"

Jocelyn Kishi and colleagues present Light-Seq, now published in Nature Methods, that combined light-directed barcoding and spatially-indexed sequencing. Basically, Light-seq allows you to sequence cells from specific areas on a histology slide thanks to laser-guided chemistry and then return to the sample later for another imaging! There are excellent tweetorials by Jocelyn herself here and by co-inventor Emma West here. If you’re into podcasts, then you’re in luck.

See threads by Fred Hutch Innovation Lab and the inimitable Luciano Martelotto. Despite the additional wash steps, it seems that you would get higher cell recovery rate. The probes exclude many genes including mitochondrial and ribosomal genes, so you would save some money for sequencing there!5\nAlexander Toenges wondered whether the ParseBio kit is suitable for BioLegend’s TotalSeq antibodies.6 There doesn’t seem to be an answer yet; would be interested to hear one!\nHave you ever thought of something that seemed to be a no-brainer but then you were proven false overwhelmingly?? Here’s a thread on the terminology of “pseudobulk”, initiated by Lior Pachter. As pointed out by many people in the thread, single-cell protocols could result in the loss of neutrophils, neurons, adipocytes, and many others, all of which will not happen if you just blender the cells and do the plain ol’ bulk RNA-Seq. Peter Karchenko and Erik van Nimwegen proposed to use the term ‘in-silico bulk’ instead."
