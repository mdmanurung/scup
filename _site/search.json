Justin Hong and colleagues from Nir Yosef’s lab presented Multi-resolution Variational Inference, or MrVI, to tackle this challenge. This method incorporate the hierarchical structure of multi-study or -site data integration. Here’s the twitter thread by Justin.\nHow should we integrate novel dataset and transfer annotations from the reference? Meng Yang and colleagues presented Concerto that leveraged contrastive learning approach to perform cell type classification, data integration, and reference mapping.2"
